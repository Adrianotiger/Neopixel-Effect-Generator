# Neopixel-Effect-Generator
Online editor to generate Arduino code for neopixel ledstrips without programming knowledge

With this editor, you can create some effects for your led strips. It is easy and you don't need to know how programming it, the code will be generated directly on the webpage.

# Try it
Open this link https://adrianotiger.github.io/Neopixel-Effect-Generator/ and begin to "draw" your animation.

## How to use the webpage?
Open the webpage and add a strip. Select the pin and led quantity. At this point you will be able to add effects to your strip dinamically. At the end press the "Generatre Arduino Code" to get the code for your Arduino.

## How create the hardware?
It is really simple:
1. Buy an Arduino (from 2$ to 15$, doesn't matter)
2. Buy a WS2812 Led Strip (30leds/1m is 4$ and 60leds/1m is 8$ for each meter)
3. Connect a power supply to the led strip and connect 1 wire from Arduino to the Led Strip (data)
4. That's it
Check the Wiki for more information.

## Want to create your own effects?
For each effect, there is a dedicated webpage on github. You can see the documentation for each effect.
Check the Wiki page to discover how create a new effect for this generator.
